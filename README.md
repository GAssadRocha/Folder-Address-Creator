# Folder Address Creator
This app was created with the intention to practice my Python abilities.

## What it does:

1.  Once you run the app, the program will create a .txt file at that folder.
2.  That file will have the address of that folder in it.
3.  It will look for folders inside of the current folder: 
    1. If there is: 
        1. It will go to each folder and repeat the process (create a .txt file, look for more folders, go into them and etc).
    3. If not:
        1. It will Stop.
        2. Or will continue the previous folder.

- [x] Works with python compiler: Anaconda
